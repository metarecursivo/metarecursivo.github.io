# Sekiro Cheat Sheet

This is an extension to Metarecursivo's Sekiro Cheatsheet found here: https://github.com/metarecursivo/Sekiro

The extension includes an 'All achievements' checklist and an 'All prosthethic tools' checklist, both on the Achievements page.

I have for the time being published this on my own github page, until Metarecursivo accepts the merge request.
