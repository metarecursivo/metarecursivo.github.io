# Sekiro Cheat Sheet

To view the cheat sheet [click here](https://metarecursivo.github.io/sekiro/index.html).

The foundation of this guide was based on the [Dark Soul 3 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet) created by [Zachary Kjellberg's](https://github.com/ZKjellberg) and the [Dark Soul 2 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet) created by [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb). I only copy & paste and learn along the way. Each checkbox is based on the [Sekiro's Game Progress Route Wiki](https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Game+Progress+Route) and my own experience with the game. I completed the guide in a effort to include all key items, sakes, minibosses etc, in a unified way.
